# Persistent AI/ML Internship

## Overview
This repository contains my four-month AI/ML internship work at Persistent Systems, focused on building an end-to-end, original machine learning solution under mentor guidance.

The internship emphasizes:
- Problem definition and research
- Data sourcing and preprocessing
- Model development and evaluation
- Explainability and optimization
- Documentation and demo-ready delivery

## Internship Details
- **Duration:** 4 months  
- **Mode:** Remote (with optional on-site visits)  
- **Mentorship:** Senior Quality Engineer, Persistent Systems  
- **Work Commitment:** ~9 hours/day
